Hi! My name is Alexandra Barnett. I am originally from West Hartford, CT and graduated from Hall High School in 2017. I graduated in May of 2021 from The University of North Carolina with a BS in Biology and a minor in Creative Writing. In May 2023, I will be graduating again from UNC-Chapel Hill with a Masters of Professional Science in Biomedical Health Informatics, which has taught me so much about the world of programming and its many practical applications.

I fell in love with programming in high school, when I learned about all of the practical, real-world applications that a career in programming can have. I am a hard worker and love seeing my work pay off in tangible, measurable ways. I am most motivated when I have a tough challenge ahead of me and can see the progress that I am making. I love learning new things and look at life as an opportunity to always be growing and improving.

I take my work-hard, play-hard philosophy into all aspects of my life. When I'm not coding or reading, you can find me playing music (I play the guitar, ukulele and banjo) or playing Ultimate Frisbee (I was the captain of the UNC women's team, Pleiades and currently play on Raleigh Radiance, the nearby women's professional team). I love making the most of my free time and pour my heart and soul into the things that matter to me.
